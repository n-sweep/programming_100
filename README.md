# Introduction
Learn the basics of programming with Python in this introductory course by building projects and learning real-world collaboration skills!

**About the Instructor:**  
My name is Noah and I'm a professional data scientist and Python developer. I started as a self-taught hobbyist programmer and while making a career change into tech, found that I enjoy helping new programmers discover coding through Python.
